Version 2.2.0

=== Notable changes in this release ===
1.  coverageBed will optionally only count features in BED file A (e.g. sequencing reads) that overlap with 
	the intervals/windows in BED file B.  This has been requested several times recently and facilitates CHiP-Seq and 
	RNA-Seq experiments.

2.  intersectBed can now require a minimum __reciprocal__ overlap between intervals in BED A and BED B.  For example,
	previously, if one used -f 0.90, it required that a feature in B overlap 90% of the feature in A for the "hit"
	to be reported.  If one adds the -r (reciprocal) option, the hit must also cover 90% of the feature in B.  This helps
	to exclude overlaps between say small features in A and large features in B:

	A ==========
	B  **********************************************************
		
	-f 0.50 (Reported), whereas -f 0.50 -r (Not reported)

3.  The score field has been changed to be a string.  While this deviates from the UCSC definition, it allows one to track
	much more meaningful information about a feature/interval.  For example, score could now be:
	
	7.31E-05  (a p-value)
	0.334577  (mean enrichment)
	2:2.2:40:2 (several values encoded in a string)
	
4.  closestBed now, by default, reports __all__ intervals in B that overlap equally with an interval in A.  Previously, it
	merely reported the first such feature that appeared in B.  Here's a cartoon explaining the difference.
	
	**Prior behavior**
	
	A	 ==============
	B.1        				++++++++++++++
	B.2       				++++++++++++++
	B.3               				+++++++++

	-----------------------------------------
	Result = B.1 			++++++++++++++
	
	
	**Current behavior**
	
	A	 ==============
	B.1        				++++++++++++++
	B.2       				++++++++++++++
	B.3               				+++++++++

	-----------------------------------------
	Result = B.1 			++++++++++++++
			 B.2 			++++++++++++++

	Using the -t option, one can also choose to report either the first or the last entry in B in the event of a tie.

5.  Several other minor changes to the algorithms have been made to increase speed a bit.


VERSION 2.1.2
1. Fixed yet another bug in the parsing of "track" or "browser" lines.  Sigh...
2. Change the "score" column (i.e. column 5) to b stored as a string.  While this deviates
   from the UCSC convention, it allows significantly more information to be packed into the column.

VERSION 2.1.1
1. Added limits.h to bedFile.h to fix compilation issues on some systems.
2. Fixed bug in testing for "track" or "browser" lines.

VERSION 2.1.0
1. Fixed a bug in peIntersectBed that prevented -a from being correctly handled when passed via stdin.
2. Added new functionality to coverageBed that calculates the density of coverage.
3. Fixed bug in geneomCoverageBed.

VERSION 2.0.1
1. Added the ability to retain UCSC browser track/browser headers in BED files.

VERSION 2.0
1.  Sped up the file parsing.  ~10-20% increase in speed.
2.  Created reportBed() as a common method in the bedFile class.  Cleans up the code quite nicely.
3.  Added the ability to compare BED files accounting for strandedness.
4.  Paired-end intersect.
5.  Fixed bug that prevented overlaps from being reported when the overlap fraction requested is 1.0


VERSION 1.2, 04/27/2009. (1eb06115bdf3c49e75793f764a70c3501bb53f33)
1.  Added subtractBed.
	A. Fixed bug that prevented "split" overlaps from being reported.
	B. Prevented A from being reported if >=1 feature in B completely spans it.
2.  Added linksBed.
3.  Added the ability to define separate windows for upstream and downstream to windowBed.


VERSION 1.1, 04/23/2009. (b74eb1afddca9b70bfa90ba763d4f2981a56f432)
Initial release.
